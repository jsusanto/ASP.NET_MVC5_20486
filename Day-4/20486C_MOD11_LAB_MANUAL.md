# Module 11: Controlling Access to ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Applications

# Lab: Controlling Access to ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Applications

#### Scenario

A large part of the functionality for your proposed Photo Sharing application is in place. However, stakeholders are concerned about security because there are no restrictions on the tasks that users can complete. The following restrictions are required:

- Only site members should be able to add or delete photos.
- Only site members should be able to add or delete comments.

You have been asked to resolve these concerns by creating a membership system for the Photo Sharing application. Visitors should be able to register as users of the web application and create user accounts for themselves. After registration, when the users sign in to the application, they will have access to actions such as adding and deleting photos and comments. Anonymous users will not have access to perform these actions. Additionally, registered users should also be able to reset their own password.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Configure a web application to use ASP.NET Form Authentication with accounts stored in Microsoft Azure SQL database.
- Write models, controllers, and views to authenticate users in a web application.
- Provide access to resources in a web application.
- Enable users to reset their own password.

#### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **90 minutes**

### Exercise 1: Configuring Authentication and Membership Providers

#### Scenario

You want to use a Microsoft Azure SQL database to store user accounts and membership information.

In this exercise, you will:

- Create a Microsoft Azure SQL database.
- Configure a provider to connect to the database.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Configure a new Microsoft Azure SQL database.

2. Install universal providers.

3. Configure providers in Web.config.

#### Task 1: Configure a new Microsoft Azure SQL database.

1. Sign in to the Microsoft Azure portal by using the following portal address::

    - **https://portal.azure.com**

2. Create a new database server and a new custom database by using the following information:

    - Database name: **PhotoAppServices**
    - Database server: **New SQL Database Server**
    - Resource group: **Create New**
    - Logon name: _&lt;your first name&gt;_
    - Logon password: **Pa$$w0rd**
    - Logon password confirmation: **Pa$$w0rd**
    - Region: _&lt;a region close to you&gt;_

3. In the list of allowed IP addresses for the **PhotoAppServices** database, add the following IP address ranges:

    - Rule name: **First Address Range**
    - Start IP address: _&lt;first address in range&gt;_
    - End IP address: _&lt;last address in range&gt;_

#### Task 2: Install universal providers

1. Open the **PhotoSharingApplication.sln** file from the following location:

    - File location: **Allfiles\20486C\Mod11\Labfiles\PhotoSharingApplication_11_begin**

2. Install the **Microsoft ASP.NET Universal Providers** package in the **PhotoSharingApplication** project by using the NuGet Package Manager.

#### Task 3: Configure providers in Web.config

1. Remove the connection string named **DefaultConnection** from the top-level Web.config file.
2. Obtain the connection string for the PhotoAppServices database and add it to the Web.config file.
3. Configure the web application to use Forms authentication in Web.config, by using the following information:

    - Parent element: **&lt;system.web&gt;**
    - Element: **&lt;authentication&gt;**
    - Mode: **Forms**

4. Configure the sign in page for the web application by using the following information:

    - Parent element: **&lt;authentication&gt;**
    - Element: **&lt;forms&gt;**
    - Logon URL: **~/Account/Login**
    - Timeout: **2880**

5. Configure the default profile provider to use the connection string named **PhotoAppServices**.
6. Configure the Default Membership Provider to use the connection string named **PhotoAppServices**.
7. Configure the Default Role Provider to use the connection string named **PhotoAppServices**.
8. Configure the Default Session Provider to use the connection string named **PhotoAppServices**.
9. Save all the changes.

>**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have created a Photo Sharing application that is configured to use Microsoft Azure SQL database for user accounts and membership information. In subsequent exercises, you will add model classes, actions, and views to implement authentication for this database.

### Exercise 2: Building the Logon and Register Views

#### Scenario

You have configured the Photo Sharing application to connect to Microsoft Azure SQL database for authentication and membership services.
