## Module 15: Deploying ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Applications

## Lab: Deploying ASP.NET MVC 5 Web Applications

#### Scenario

You have completed the development and testing of the photo sharing application. Your managers and senior developers have signed off the project, and have requested you to deploy the application to the Adventure Works Microsoft Azure account.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Prepare an MVC web application for deployment.
- Deploy an MVC web application to Microsoft Azure.

#### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **45 minutes**

In this lab, you will create a web application in Microsoft Azure that runs in Free mode. Free mode is an excellent tool for testing and running small, non-intensive web applications. However, there is a limit of data transfer per day on the Free mode tool. After completing Exercise 2, you are encouraged to further test the deployed web application. However, if you do a lot of extra testing, you may encounter the limit and the application may become unavailable.

>**Note:** This lab is dependent on the successful execution of the lab of Modules 11 and 13. If you have not executed labs of Modules 11 and 13, this lab will not function properly.

### Exercise 1: Deploying a Web Application to Microsoft Azure

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will:

	- Pricing tier: **D1 Shared**

#### Task 3: Deploy the Photo Sharing application.

1. In Microsoft Edge, download the publish profile for the _&lt;your username&gt;_ **PhotoSharing** web application.

2. In Microsoft Visual Studio, start the Publish Web wizard and import the publish profile you just downloaded.
3. Publish the web application.

  >**Results** : After completing this exercise, you will be able to prepare an ASP.NET MVC web application for production deployment, create a web application in Microsoft Azure, and deploy an MVC web application to Microsoft Azure.

### Exercise 2: Testing the Completed Application

#### Scenario

You have completed and fully deployed the Photo Sharing web application in Microsoft Azure. Now, you want to perform some final functionality tests before you confirm the completion of the application to your manager.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:
