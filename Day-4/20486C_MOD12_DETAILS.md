### Exercise 1: Creating Favorites Controller Actions

#### Task 1: Create the Favorites Slideshow action.

1. On the taskbar, click the **File Explorer** icon.
2. In the **Libraries** window, go to **Allfiles/20486C/Mod12/labfiles/PhotoSharingApplication_12_begin**, and then double-click **PhotoSharingApplication.sln**.
3. On the **BUILD** menu of the **PhotoSharingApplication - Microsoft Visual Studio** window, click Build Solution.
4. In the **Solution Explorer** pane of the **PhotoSharingApplication - Microsoft Visual Studio** window, expand **PhotoSharingApplication**, expand **Controllers**, and then click **PhotoController.cs**.
5. In the **PhotoController.cs** code window, locate the following code.

  ```cs
       public ActionResult SlideShow()
       {
          return View("SlideShow", context.Photos.ToList());
       }
```
6. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the located code, press Enter twice, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
       public ActionResult FavoritesSlideShow()
       {
       }
```
7. Place the cursor within the **FavoritesSlideShow** action code block you just created, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        List<Photo> favPhotos = new List<Photo>();
```
8. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the **favPhotos** list code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        List<int> favoriteIds = Session["Favorites"] as List<int>;
```
9. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the **favoriteIds** list code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        if (favoriteIds == null)
        {
           favoriteIds = new List<int>();
        }
```
10. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the **if** statement code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        Photo currentPhoto;
```
11. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the **currentPhoto** object code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        foreach (int currentId in favoriteIds)
        {
        }
```
12. Place the mouse cursor within the **foreach** code block you just created, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        currentPhoto = context.FindPhotoById(currentId);
```
13. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the code you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        if (currentPhoto != null)
        {
           favPhotos.Add(currentPhoto);
        }
```
14. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the **foreach** code block you created earlier, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
        return View("SlideShow", favPhotos);
```
   >**Note:** You do not need to create a new view for the **FavoritesSlideShow** action. Instead, you can re-use the **SlideShow.cshtml** view by passing a different list of **Photo** objects.

15. On the **FILE** menu of the **PhotoSharingApplication – Microsoft Visual Studio** window, click **Save All**.

#### Task 2: Create the Add Favorite action.

1. Place the mouse cursor immediately after the **FavoritesSlideShow** action code block, but inside the **PhotoController** class code block, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
       public ContentResult AddFavorite(int PhotoId)
       {
       }
```
2. Place the cursor within the **AddFavorite** action code block you just created, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
       List<int> favoriteIds = Session["Favorites"] as List<int>;
```
3. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the **favoriteIds** list code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
       if (favoriteIds == null)
       {
          favoriteIds = new List<int>();
       }
```
4. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the code block you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
       favoriteIds.Add(PhotoId);
```
5. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the code you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
       Session["Favorites"] = favoriteIds;
```
6. Place the mouse cursor at the end of the code you just created, press Enter, and then type the following code.

  ```cs
       return Content("The picture has been added to your favorites", "text/plain", System.Text.Encoding.Default);
```
7. On the **FILE** menu of the **PhotoSharingApplication – Microsoft Visual Studio** window, click **Save All**.

>**Results**: After completing this exercise, you should have successfully created controller actions that store values in the session state of the web application, and retrieved values from the same session state.

### Exercise 2: Implementing Favorites in Views

#### Task 1: Add an AJAX action link in the Photo Display view.

1. In the **Solution Explorer** pane of the **PhotoSharingApplication - Microsoft Visual Studio** window, expand **Views**, expand **Photo**, and then click **Display.cshtml**.

```
10. On the **FILE** menu of the **PhotoSharingApplication – Microsoft Visual Studio** window, click **Save All**.

#### Task 3: Test favorites.

1. On the **DEBUG** menu of the **PhotoSharingApplication - Microsoft Visual Studio** window, click **Start Debugging**.

   >**Note:** On the **Welcome to Adventure Works Photo Sharing** page, note that there is no link to the **FavoritesSlideShow** action.

2. On the **Welcome to Adventure Works Photo Sharing** page, click **All Photos**.
3. On the **All Photos** page, click **Display** corresponding to any photo of your choice.

   >**Note:** Ensure that the photo you have selected is not already added to the favorites list.

4. On the result page, click **Add this photo to your favorites**.

   >**Note:** The message, **The picture has been added to your favorites** displays. This indicates that the AJAX action displays a confirmation message without a full-page reload.

5. On the result page, click **Back to List**.
6. On the **All Photos** page, click **Display** corresponding to any photo of your choice.

   >**Note:** Ensure that the photo you have selected is not already added to the favorites list.

On the **Home** page, if you are not able to view the **Favorite Photos** link, click **Refresh**.

11. In the **Microsoft Edge** window, click **Close**.
12. On the **DEBUG** menu of the **PhotoSharingApplication - Microsoft Visual Studio** window, click **Stop Debugging**.
13. In the **PhotoSharingApplication - Microsoft Visual Studio** window, click **Close**.

>**Results**: After completing this exercise, you will be able to
